# Install standalone MSR

1. Generate a configuration values file for the chart:

    ```bash
    helm show values oci://registry.mirantis.com/harbor/helm/msr --version <MSR-VERSION>
    ```

2. Helm automatically creates certificates. To manually create your own, follow
   these steps:

    1. Create a directory for certificates named `certs`:

        ```bash
        mkdir certs
        ```

    2. Create a `certs.conf` text file in the `certs` directory:

        ```bash
        [req]
        distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
        x509_extensions = v3_req
        prompt = no

        [req_distinguished_name]
        C = US
        ST = State
        L = City
        O = Organization
        OU = Organizational Unit
        CN = msr

        [v3_req]
        keyUsage = digitalSignature, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
        extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
        subjectAltName = @alt_names

        [alt_names]
        IP.1 = <IP-ADDRESS-OF-WORKERNODE>  # Replace with your actual IP address
        ```

    3. Generate the certificate and the key using the `certs.conf` file  
       you just created:

        ```bash
        openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -config certs.conf
        ```

3. If you are using the Helm certificates skip this step. If you manually
   created your own certificates, create the Kubernetes secret. Run the
   following command from outside of the `certs` folder:

    ```bash
    kubectl create secret tls <NAME-OF-YOUR-SECRET> \
        --cert=certs/tls.crt \
        --key=certs/tls.key
    ```

4. Modify the `msr-values.yaml` file to configure MSR:

    - Set the expose type:
 
         ```yaml
         expose:
             # Set how to expose the service. Set the type as "ingress",
             # "clusterIP", "nodePort" or "loadBalancer" and fill the
             # information in the corresponding section
             type: nodePort
         ```
 
    - Set the cert source to TLS and the secret name:
 
         ```yaml
         certSource: secret
         secret:
             # The name of secret which contains keys named:
             # "tls.crt" - the certificate
             # "tls.key" - the private key
             secretName: "<NAME-OF-YOUR-SECRET>"
         ```
 
    - Set the ``nodePort`` values to allow ``nodePort ingress``. You can use any
      ephemeral port, but note that some Kubernetes distributions restrict
      the allowed range. The range ``32768–35535`` is generally accepted.
 
         ```yaml
         nodePort:
             # The name of NodePort service
             name: harbor
             ports:
                 http:
                     # The service port Harbor listens on when serving HTTP
                     port: 80
                     # The node port Harbor listens on when serving HTTP
                     nodePort: <httpNodePort>
                 https:
                     # The service port Harbor listens on when serving HTTPS
                     port: 443
                     # The node port Harbor listens on when serving HTTPS
                     nodePort: <httpNodePort>
         ```
 
    - Set the external URL, if using nodePort use a worker node IP address,
      the same one that you used during generating of the cert:
 
         ```yaml
         externalURL: https://<A-WORKER-NODE-EXTERNAL-IP:httpsnodePort>
         ```

    - Enable data persistence:

         ```yaml
         persistence:
             enabled: true
         ```

         If you are using a named StorageClass (as opposed to the default  
         StorageClass) you need to specify it as shown in the following sample:

         ```yaml
         persistence:
             enabled: true
             resourcePolicy: "keep"
             persistentVolumeClaim:
                 registry:
                     existingClaim: ""
                     storageClass: "<STORAGE-CLASS-NAME>"
                     subPath: ""
                     accessMode: ReadWriteOnce
                     size: 5Gi
                     annotations: {}
         ```

    - Set the initial admin password:

        ```yaml
        harborAdminPassword: "Harbor12345"
        ```

        !!! note

            After you launch MSR 4, change the admin password from the  
            MSR web UI, or provide an existing secret using the  
            `existingSecretAdminPasswordKey` parameter.

    - Set the replica number to ``1`` under ``portal``, ``registry``, ``core``,
      ``trivy`` and ``jobservice``:

         ```yaml
         jobservice:
             image:
                 repository: harbor-jobservice
             replicas: 1
         ```

    - Set PostgreSQL as an internal database:

         ```yaml
         database:
             # if external database is used, set "type" to "external"
             # and fill the connection information in "external" section
             type: internal
         ```

    - Set Redis as an internal database:

         ```yaml
         redis:
             # if external Redis is used, set "type" to "external"
             # and fill the connection information in "external" section
             type: internal
         ```

    - Check your settings against a full example of MSR configuration:

         ```yaml
         expose:
          type: nodePort
         persistence:
           enabled: true
           resourcePolicy: "keep"
           persistentVolumeClaim:
             registry:
               storageClass: "<STORAGE-CLASS-NAME>"
               accessMode: ReadWriteOnce
               size: 5Gi
             jobservice:
               jobLog:
                 storageClass: "<STORAGE-CLASS-NAME>"
                 accessMode: ReadWriteOnce
                 size: 5Gi
             trivy:
               storageClass: "<STORAGE-CLASS-NAME>"
               accessMode: ReadWriteOnce
               size: 5Gi
         portal:
           replicas: 1
         core:
          replicas: 1
         jobservice:
           replicas: 1
         registry:
           replicas: 1
         trivy:
          replicas: 1
         database:
           type: internal
         redis:
           type: internal
         ```

5. Install MSR using Helm:

    ```bash
    helm install my-release oci://registry.mirantis.com/harbor/helm/msr \
        --version <MSR-VERSION> -f <PATH-TO/msr-values.yaml>
    ```

6. Configure Docker to trust the self-signed certificate. On the system logged
   into MSR:

    1. Create a directory:

        ```bash
        /etc/docker/certs.d/<IPADDRESS:NODEPORT>
        ```

    2. Move and rename the certificate:

        ```bash
        mv tls.crt /etc/docker/certs.d/<IPADDRESS:NODEPORT>/ca.crt
        ```

    3. Access the MSR web UI at  
       `https://<WORKER-NODE-EXTERNAL-IP>:<httpsNodePort>`  
       provided the same NodePort numbers were used as specified in this  
       guide. You can also log in using:

        ```bash
        docker login <WORKER-NODE-EXTERNAL-IP>:<httpsNodePort>
        ```

    !!! warning
        By default, robot account names start with the `$` character, which  
        some software may interpret as a variable. As such, you should change  
        the default prefix to avoid any potential issues:

        1. Log in to the MSR 4 web UI with an account that has administrator  
           privileges.
        2. Navigate to **Configuration** and select **System Settings**.
        3. In the **Robot Name Prefix** row, modify the prefix.
