# DB Service (PostgreSQL) Security

PostgreSQL is a relational database, and its security is vital for ensuring
data protection and maintaining compliance with regulations. Securing
PostgreSQL helps safeguard sensitive information from unauthorized access,
tampering, and potential breaches, ensuring that both the integrity and
confidentiality of the data are preserved. Proper security measures are
essential for both operational efficiency and regulatory adherence.

## Authentication and Authorization

It is essential to enforce strong password policies for all database users to
prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, enabling SSL for encrypted
connections ensures that data transmitted between clients and the PostgreSQL
server is secure.

To further enhance security, use PostgreSQL roles to implement the least
privileged access to databases and tables. Each application component should
have its own dedicated database user, with only the minimum required
permissions granted. This reduces the risk of unauthorized actions and ensures
that users can only access the data they need to perform their tasks.

## Data Encryption

To protect sensitive data stored on disk, enable data-at-rest encryption in
PostgreSQL. This ensures that any data stored in the database is encrypted
and remains secure even if the underlying storage is compromised.

Additionally, use SSL/TLS for data-in-transit encryption to secure
communications between PostgreSQL and application components. This ensures
that data exchanged between the database and clients is encrypted, preventing
interception or tampering during transit.

## Access Control

To enhance security, ensure that PostgreSQL is not directly accessible from
the public internet. Use Kubernetes Network Policies to restrict access to
authorized services only, ensuring that only trusted internal services can
communicate with the database.

Additionally, apply restrictions to limit access based on IP addresses,
allowing only trusted sources to connect to PostgreSQL. Furthermore, configure
client authentication methods, such as certificate-based authentication, to
further secure access and ensure that only authenticated clients can interact
with the database.

## Backups and Disaster Recovery

Regularly backing up the PostgreSQL database is crucial to ensure data
integrity and availability. It is essential that backup files are stored
securely, preferably in an encrypted format, to protect them from unauthorized
access or tampering.

Additionally, enable point-in-time recovery (PITR) to provide the ability to
recover the database to a specific state in case of corruption or failure.
PITR ensures minimal data loss and allows for quick recovery in the event of
an incident.
