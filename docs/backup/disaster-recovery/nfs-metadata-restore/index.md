# NFS Metadata Restore

The procedure herein details the steps required to perform a cross-cluster
disaster recovery restore of an MSR 4 instance. This method is intended for
environments wherein both the source and target Kubernetes clusters use the
same underlying NFS storage backend along with MinIO backup storage.

Shared persistent storage significantly accelerates the recovery process by
circumventing the movement of large registry data files.

## Prerequisites

- A freshly provisioned Kubernetes cluster that is
  ready for application deployment and free of any existing state
  or active resources that conflict with the deployment of the restored
  MSR 4 stack.
- Verify that a compatible CSI driver is installed and configured in your
  Kubernetes cluster. For Snapshot backup, the CSI driver must support snapshot
  operations for your storage provider.

## Procedure

* [Install MinIO and Velero](metadata-install-minio-and-velero.md)
* [Backup and Restore](metadata-restore-backup.md)
